            <strong>Reading</strong>
            <br>
            <p>I love reading books, especially science fiction and fantasy. It helps me escape reality and stimulates my imagination. I also enjoy read self-help and psychological books and help boost my mental capabilities.</p>

            <strong>Exercising</strong>
            <br>
            <p>I could never stop exercising as long as I can remember; whether it was hitting the gym, going for a run or plaing basketball with friends.</p>
        </li>

            <strong>Learning</strong>
            <br>
            <p>I am always intrigued by different things and I am curious enough to dable in them. This full-stack development is an example of it. Another example would be trying to learn different languages like german and norwegian.</p>

            <strong>Cafe Hopping</strong>
            <br>
